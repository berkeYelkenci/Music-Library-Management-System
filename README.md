# Music-Library-Management-System

This was my second grade first term project for Java Programming. I used Java Swing Library as well as MySql. It was all about song management system.
-All you need to do is enter your song into system via windows provided.
-After thet you can search directly from database(I know this way is inefficient but it is working.)
-You are able to manipulate songs (edit,delete,display all or search...)

PS: This is my first project that I uplouded on GitHub so it's a bit of mess sorrys in advance...
